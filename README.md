# InspiredByBradTraversy
Udemy Course expanded

### Please read docs.md to experience a full documentation
The code is plain vanilla js and inspired by Brad Traversy (owner of Traversy Media, you find him all over the www). The Udemy Course has the name "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML/CSS/JavaScript."  Brad's idea was that the students pick his "starters" and then expand upon them. That is precisely what this repos is about.

"My code" is beyond the scope of this inspiring course, but it is definetly still in the sense of the course. Gathering ideas, keeping it simple and minimalistic.
