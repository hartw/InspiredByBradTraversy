##### License and Disclaimer:

- no restriction imposed by me. But you take all the risk and responsibility.
- The code is plain vanilla js and inspired by Brad Traversy (owner of
  Traversy Media). The Udemy Course has the name "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML/CSS/JavaScript."
  Brad's idea is precisely that the students pick his "starters" and then expand upon them.

- "My code" is beyond the scope of this inspiring course, but
  it is definetly still in the sense of the course. Gathering ideas,
  keeping it simple and minimalistic.

- It is also important to note that I am not a professional developer.
  Codeing is one of my ways to experience "artificial intelligence".
  Many of the ideas come from AI through continuously improved communication.
